Introduction:
This project implements object detection using the YOLO algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect multiple objects in an image or video frame with high accuracy and speed.

Features:
Real-time object detection on images and videos
Pre-trained YOLO models
Custom training on your dataset
Easy-to-use interface
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries:
numpy
opencv-python
tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the YOLO implementation)
matplotlib
